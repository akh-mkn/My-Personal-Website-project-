<p>Who is this Matti guy? Just a question I'm hoping is running through your mind currently. Well, let's break this down into a few short sweet sections, not so much to bore you, but just about enough to keep you engaged!</p>
<br>
<div class = "custom-paragraph-4">
    <p><mark>1. Introduction [brief]</mark></p>
</div>

<p> I'm Matti! My full first name in the Arabic language is actually Ù…Ø·ÙŠØ¹ Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡, but family and friends have always known me as matti for short. ðŸ˜ƒ

    At the time of writing this, Iâ€™m a first year technology developer apprentice at Barclays, and enthusiastic to see how this will enlighten the many years of my journey to come ahead.
    
    Staying stagnant is far from who I am. Via my apprenticeship, I hope to eventually be in the position in the next 5-6 years to head overseas to the UAE and continue my story there ðŸ›«
</p>

<p>
    I was born in East London, and raised in South East London. Although my environment was challenging at times, I ensured to keep my head down, focussing on my studies, and emerging from my Secondary School education with a range of grades from A**'s - A's. I then went on a further two years to study Physics, Maths and Computer Science, achieving a range of PASSES in each of these fields of studies, and accomplishing an A* in my programming project for Computer Science!

    <p><mark>2. My Interests</mark></p>
</div>

<p>Where do I begin? As broad as this could get, I'll mention a few current interests of mine. Number one is self-development. I'm relentless in setting goals and trying to become a different person [for the better] at the end of each year which goes by. My driving factor? To have no regrets at death. I'm fuelled to grow spirtually, and as a person in this life as long as I remain.
    Number two would be fitness. <span class = "hl">"It is a shame for a person to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which their body is capable."</span> -Socrates Fin. Need I say more? Number three would be trading the foreign markets. Forex is something I was dabbled into from a young age, abandoned, and now a skill I am learning on the side. My goal is to attain a funded account with a prop-firm and begin another source of income. All in the name of entrepreneurship.

    <p><mark>3. What am I good at?</mark></p>
</div>
<p>As humble as one can be, we may be sat here all day going over my skills, so let me shoot out a few random hobbies I have devoted enough time to, to become decent at. I would say I am good at boxing/combat to begin with. Since a young age at family link ups and training on my own, I put in several hours into boxing, wrestling etc. Now, I wish to pursue Muay Thai and deepen my skillset through the sport. Something else I am quite good at is football. Throughout my years in school, I played football with a passion for a football club, and was a key asset in playmaking. And, to wrap things up, anything creativity based I would say I am good at. I've always had a desire since young to create things. Examples are evident in a youtube gaming channel I created, which flourished other skills such as editing, audio syncing etc. I would also write books online for others to read, and so on and so forth!
