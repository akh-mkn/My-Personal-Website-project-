<h2>Programming Project</h2>
</div>
<p>
    My A-Level computer science subject required me to embark on the journey of developing a game whilst producing in detailed documentation alongside it. 

As someone who isnâ€™t proficient largely in the world of coding, I had to undergo a lot of research and take benefit from many online resources, broadening my understanding to bring the game together. 

The documentation was highly demanding, several sections covering different aspects of the development journey, starting right from analysis to post evaluation. 

I achieved an A* as my final grade on it.
