    <p>Greetings! My name is Matti, and you have successfully landed on my first ever website. There's lots to explore, and using the handy tool just above this block of text allows you to jump between my website with the click of a button. But.. enough about the technicals. A quote I came up with some one or two years ago was the following:</p>

</div>

<div class = "custom-paragraph-2">
    <p><b>Persistence, Progression, Perfection.</b></p>


</div>

<p>Pretty cool right? As short and simple as it may seem, it's something I believe we should all commit to in our day to day activities, and within our journey in life as a whole. Sure, achieving perfection may not seem realistic, but knocking at its door is fine by me.</p>

<div class = "custom-paragraph-3">
    <p>Now, don't be too mesmerised by the calming picture below, and head on to my bio page next!</p>
